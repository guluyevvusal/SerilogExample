⭕ Serilog is a popular logging library used in the .NET programming language. Serilog can write logs in a structured way to more easily monitor the application's performance, and saves the logs in JSON format for easy analysis.


⭕ Serilog goes much further than simply storing information in text form, enriching logs with timestamp, message, level (status of information) and other special fields. This helps to find problems faster and analyze system performance.

 
⭕ What Is Serilog Used For?

▶️  Diagnose Errors: With Serilog, errors and warnings are easily logged and allow you to trace what is going wrong in the application.

▶️ Application Performance: Helps analyze application performance by storing input and output data.

▶️  Auditing and User Tracking: Useful for tracking user activity and how data is accessed.

▶️  Structured Data: Structured logging in JSON format facilitates analysis and makes logs more meaningful.


⭕ When Should We Use Serilog?

▶️  Serilog should be used mainly in the following cases:

▶️  Troubleshooting: To trace the source of any error when it occurs.

▶️  Real-Time Monitoring: When we want to add real-time monitoring to a service or API.

▶️  For Auditing Purposes: To monitor user and cross-application activities of the Software.

▶️  Load and Performance Tests: To monitor how what operations are performed when the application is loaded.
